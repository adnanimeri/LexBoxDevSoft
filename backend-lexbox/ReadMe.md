## The backend will provide:

All the API endpoints your frontend is already calling
PostgreSQL database with the schema from the specification
JWT authentication (replaces your mock auth)
Document upload/download
Timeline management
Billing system

## Benefits using Node.js

- Matches your React frontend perfectly
- Same JavaScript ecosystem
- Can be built in 1-2 weeks
- All REST APIs align with your frontend service calls
- Includes file upload for documents
- Role-based authentication ready

## Tech Stack 
- Node.js + Express (same language as frontend)
- PostgreSQL (as per your specification)
- Sequelize ORM (easier database management)
- JWT Authentication (secure and stateless)
- Multer (file upload handling)
